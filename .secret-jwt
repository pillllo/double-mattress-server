1) Head here https://jwt.io/
2) Paste all the info below into each box on the right hand side
Unfortunately VERIFY SIGNATURE needs to be manually typed :(

## HEADER ##

{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

## PAYLOAD ##

{
  "sub": "codeworks-senior",
  "name": "double-mattress-server",
  "iat": 1516239022
}

## VERIFY SIGNATURE ##

STORE_ALL_YOUR_$$$_UNDER_YOUR_MATTRESS

(NB ensure checkbox "secret base64 encoded" is checked)

3) JWT will be autogenerated with each keystroke, no need to manually update
4) copy the JWT from the box on the left
5) add as a .env variable with key of CLIENT_JWT (i.e. CLIENT_JWT=jwt_goes_here)

UPDATING POSTMAN TO USE THE JWT

This process adds an Authorization header to every request in the collection.

1) Click "Collections" from left hand bar
2) Click the "double-mattress" collection (the top bar, NOT one of the individual requests in the collection)
3) click the "Authorization" tab
4) Change the Type to "API Key"
5) Update the "Key" field : "Client-Jwt"
6) Update the "Value" field to be the JWT you copied earlier
7) Ensure "Add to" is set to "Header"
8) Click Save button
9) Send a test request to GET /userIds. If you get a 404 you have done something wrong
